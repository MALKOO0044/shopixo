System Overview
A complete automated product sourcing system with manual approval at every step - nothing goes live without admin confirmation.

Database Schema (New Tables Needed)
Table	Purpose
pricing_rules	Category margins, VAT rates, smart rounding rules
import_batches	Group search sessions (e.g., "Summer Dresses Batch #12")
product_queue	Products discovered but not yet imported (pending/approved/rejected)
import_logs	Full audit trail of all imports and updates
daily_sync_changes	Store detected price/stock changes for morning review
Phase 1: Admin Dashboard Enhancement

Phase 3: KSA Pricing Engine
Time: Day 2-3

Pricing Formula:

Base Cost          = CJ Product Price

+ Payment Fee      = 2.9% of total
+ Profit Margin    = Configurable % per category
────────────────────────────────────────────────
= Final Price      → Smart rounded to: 49/79/99/149/199/249/299 SAR
